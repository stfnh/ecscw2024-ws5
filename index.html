      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Participatory research in the healthcare sector is fraught with obstacles. In particular, choosing appropriate methods to involve the heterogeneous stakeholders in the healthcare system can be difficult. Not only are time constraints and hierarchies between professional (and non-professional) healthcare actors a challenge, but also dealing with patients who may have different physical and psychological limitations. Accordingly, not all qualitative methods are applicable to all stakeholder groups. Limitations such as impairments and low literacy levels can make it difficult to participate in focus groups or design workshops. In this workshop we will discuss experiences with participatory methods in the health sector and explore how established methods can be made more inclusive so that they can be adapted to a wide range of stakeholders.

      <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
      <p>
        We invite interested scholars, practitioners and everyone else to submit a position paper of no more than 2 pages, excluding references, formatted according to the ECSCW template. Authors are invited to submit methodological reflections, reflections and lessons learned of former case studies, challenges and failure stories of former case studies, ethical or political considerations, philosophical or theoretical reflections. Example cases could be problematizing the motivation for WS participants (Why should I attend? What do I gain from this?) or sustainable partnerships and collaborations beyond single co-creation projects/workshops.

      <h2>Workshop Goals and Activities</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of this workshop is to highlight different challenges when using co-creation methods in healthcare, especially when working with heterogeneous groups like healthcare experts and patients with vulnerabilities. Therefore, we want to bring together a diverse group of researchers with experience in co-creation in         healthcare, so that a discussion from different disciplines and perspectives is possible. In order to maximize interaction and networking between participants, the         workshop will take place on site in Rimini for one full day. In addition to the on-site activities, we will invite a healthcare expert to join the session virtually. We        expect the expert to have fruitful insights and to be an important factor in the discussion. The discussion points will be recorded and prepared in such a way that participants who are unable to attend will be able to benefit from the workshop. Upon receipt of acceptance, the workshop website will be published with all relevant information, including position papers and authors.
      </p>
      <h3>Workshop introduction</h3>
      <p>The workshop begins with an introduction to the objectives, timetable, expected outcomes and structure, including paper presentations, group discussions and possible adaptations to existing qualitative methods.</p>
      <p>Clear and concise communication from the organizers will engage and focus participants for full participation. Participants will introduce themselves and their research, building empathy and understanding for the interdisciplinary discussions that will follow.</p>
      <h3>Presentations</h3>
      <p>
        In a brainstorming session participants are asked to discuss the experiences from the previous presentations and what impact they have on participatory methods used. The session therefore deals with questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What other challenges might there be beyond those presented?</li>
        <li>Which traditional qualitative methods might not be applicable to vulnerable people without adapting the method to their needs and perspectives?</li>
        <li>Which vulnerabilities require which adaptation of qualitative methods?</li>
        <li>What are good practices in participatory research in healthcare?</li>
        <li>What innovative approaches or technologies might help?</li>
        <li>What are the reasons behind the potential failures when using existing methods?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Designing the future</h3>
      <p>
        In this session the participants are divided into small groups for discussion. Each of these groups will be given one of the qualitative methods discussed earlier, with the aim of adapting it to minimize the challenges of working with the previously collected stakeholder groups and the cases presented by the organizers and participants. To do this, the groups first clearly define the problems and challenges that arise. Ideas are then generated, prioritized, and collected (e.g. in the form of a mind map, storyboard or similar). Participants are encouraged to express unconventional ideas and not to evaluate solutions immediately. The ideas are then discussed and evaluated against the background of the different stakeholders, projects, work cultures and hierarchies, institutional settings, resources and time constraints and political influences.
      </p>
      <h3>Working Group</h3>
      <p>To ensure the publication of the workshop results, we have allocated the second half of the workshop solely to the joint publication. Our goal is to produce a high-quality report on co-creation in healthcare. Therefore, we will start by discussing the type of publication and where to publish. After that, we will form groups to research the literature, gather and compare case studies and reflect on discussions and the workshop itself. This will be an active writing session to support publishing results afterwards.</p>
      <h3>Wrap up and next steps</h3>
      <p>Results from the former sessions will be collectively synthesized into a methodological and conceptual “road map” of appropriate design concepts and methodological approaches for participatory work in the healthcare domain. These findings will reveal an understanding on specific actions to make co-researchers comfortable and experience co-creation as a meaningful activity while being aware of possible limitations.</p>

      <h2>Post-workshop and expected outcomes</h2>
      <p>During the workshop, we will start creating a joint reflection paper on co-creative methods in healthcare with the participants. In this paper we would use the position papers of the participants and reflect on the discussions of the workshop in the form of a workshop report in collaboration with the participants or in the form of a special issue of a journal. The journal in which the report will be published will be discussed with the participants during the workshop. One suggestion would be <a href="https://www.iisi.de/international-reports-on-socio-informatics-irsi/" target="_blank">IRSI - an open-source online journal</a>. This will require further collaboration after the workshop, so we will establish a communication channel with all participants for sustainable collaboration between all.</p>

      <h2>Recruitment and participants selection</h2>
      <p>The workshop aims to facilitate an interdisciplinary discussion on challenges of participatory design in healthcare by bringing together experts from various fields like HCI, CSCW, health informatics and involving groups of people with diverse backgrounds. The organizers plan to accept 10 submissions and invite approximately 15 people to the workshop. The call for position papers will be sent to various interdisciplinary mailing lists including ACM, HCI, (E)CSCW, health sciences, EUSSET email list, Research Network "Ageing in Europe" of the European Sociological Association, the German Network for Participatory Health Research (PartNet), Health Geography, feminist geography and all our research partners from our current research projects. In addition, our workshop website will promote the workshop and clearly present the most important information.</p>
